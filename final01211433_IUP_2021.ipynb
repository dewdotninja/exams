    "1. This exam is administered online via Google classroom only in Jupyter and Pluto notebook formats. Choose only one. For Jupyter notebook, you can use Colab environment or install Jupyter notebook on your local machine. For Pluto notebook, print your work to .PDF format before submitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Do your work solely on this notebook. You can add as many cells as you want. Formatting is not necessary as long as your texts/equations are understandable and answer the question clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Open books, notes and online resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Explain clearly. Show details of your computation to receive full credits. For any problem that requires programming, your program should execute without error and give correct results.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Do not change any problem. A problem that is altered in any way from the original will result in zero score for that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Some parameters in the problem set may be a function of your student ID. You must make sure to substitute the right value for such parameters. Failure to do so may result in heavy penalty for that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Do this exam solely by yourself without any help from any person. Be warned that an answer that is incorrect and has suspicious similarity with that of another exam taker may receive no partial credit for that problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Exam problems typically range from basic to advanced. Work on simple problems before moving to challenging ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Important :** Students must submit your notebook promptly, in Google classroom only, when the exam period expires. Resubmission is acceptable only within the exam period. Anyone who submits/resubmits later than 10 minutes after the exam period, as indicated in the recorded history of Google classroom, will get -1 point penalty per minute, starting from -10. Anyone sumbitting his/her exam more than 30-minutes late may be considered cheating and may get zero score for the whole midterm.\n",
