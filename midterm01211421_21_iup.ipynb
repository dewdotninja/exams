    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You can use Colab environment or install Jupyter notebook on your local machine. \n",
    "Type your work solely on this notebook. You can add as many cells as you want. \n",
    "Formatting is not necessary as long as your texts/equations are understandable and \n",
    "answer the question clearly.\n",
    "2. Open books, notes and online resources.\n",
    "3. Explain clearly. Show details of your computation to receive full credits. For any problem \n",
    "that requires programming, your program should execute without error and give the correct \n",
    "result.\n",
    "4. Do not change any problem. \n",
    "5. Some parameters in the problem set may be a function of your student ID. You must make sure \n",
    "to substitute the right value for such parameters.\n",
    "6. In case you are totally hopeless with Python, the only other softwares that are allowed are MATLAB \n",
    "and Scilab. Students must provide complete MATLAB/Scilab scripts and also capture the \n",
    "output/graph images to the notebook by using the image tag with image files in a public URL.\n",
    "If some relevant information is missing, you may receive only partial credit. Since this is a \n",
    "time-consuming process and may be problematic, doing all your work with Python in Jupyter notebook\n",
    "is strongly recommended.\n",
    "7. The difficulty of each problem is indicated by level (1 = basic, 2 = intermediate, 3 = advanced). Normally, you\n",
    "should attempt to start with easy ones.\n",
    "8. <b>Important : </b>Students must submit your notebook promptly, in Google classroom only,\n",
    "when the 3-hour exam period expires. Resubmission is acceptable only within the exam period. \n",
    "<br><em>Anyone who submits/resubmits later than 10 minutes after the exam period, as indicated in the \n",
    "recorded history of Google classroom, may be considered cheating and may fail this exam.</em>\n",
